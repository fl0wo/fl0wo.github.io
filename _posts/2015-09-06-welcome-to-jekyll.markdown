# Intro
I have always wanted to share my knowledge with the world.
# Who am I?
I’m not an expert on anything, but I can share what I know and help people who are in need.
# Why do I want to do this?
Writing blogs takes time and effort, and building a website so everybody can read it, it’s not something quick to do.

So why do I want to do it anyway?

During my life in the time I faced some challenges I wish I already knew the solution, or at least, found someone else on the web-facing the same issue as mine.
I want to write to help others, situated in a position that was similar to mine.
If I write down solutions to problems I have, and it’s helpful to people that have the same need, I’m helping my similars, in other words, I’m helping my self.
# Conclusion
I don't want nothing from people, I just want to collect “points” from God, by helping others and doing good deeds
