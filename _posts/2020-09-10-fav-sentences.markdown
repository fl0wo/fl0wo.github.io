# Intro
I'll list all the sentences that most rappresent me and the way I like thinking.

# Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.
<small>

# Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.
<small>
You cannot obtain success on the end-point, success can be measured during the whole process.
</small>

# Every one of us is the sum total of his own thoughts.
<small>
It is 100% your fault or merit that you are in this situation.
</small>

# I try to make all spending decisions as if the price were 0$. And I make all work and income decisions as if the wage were 0$
<small>

# You become what you think about.
<small>
If you think about nothing, you become nothing.
