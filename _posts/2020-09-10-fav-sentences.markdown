# Intro
I'll list all the sentences that most represent me and the way I like thinking.

# Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.
My only concern when facing a problem is finding the solution, not finding the guilty.
The questions of someone can clearly reveal their goal. If the question is aimed at finding a solution rather than finding the guilty, then I believe that person is worthy of listening to.


# Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.
You cannot obtain success on the end-point, success can be measured during the whole process.

# Every one of us is the sum total of his own thoughts.
It is 100% your fault or merit that you are in this situation.

# Refuse to believe that there are circumstances strong enough to defeat you in achieving your goal.
God gave you two eyes to see, two arms to reach, two hands to grab, two legs to walk, two ears to listen, you have no excuses.

# I try to make all spending decisions as if the price were 0$. And I make all work and income decisions as if the wage were 0$
The really free man is the one that decisions are not affected by the price of everything.
For both buying stuff, or for working on something. This doesn't mean that this person is someone willing to waste money on random things, it just means that the decision is not affected by the monetary value but by other factors.

# You become what you think about.
If you think about nothing, you become nothing.
